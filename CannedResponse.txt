"CannedResponse" by DavesCodeMusings

[
  An example of non-player characters replying to multiple things with a limited number of reponses.

  Test with: "get on table / ah / say ah / yes / no / it hurts when I go like this / sorry"
]

The Exam Room is a room. "Why don't you hop up on the table and let's have a look at you."
In the Exam Room is a person called Doctor Eckleburg.
The exam table is a supporter in the Exam Room. It is fixed in place and enterable.
After entering the exam table, say "Open up and say ah."
Instead of saying yes in the presence of the Doctor Eckleburg, say "Mmm. Mm-hmm. Very interesting."
Understand "ah" and "say ah" as saying yes when location is Exam Room.
Instead of saying no in the presence of the Doctor Eckleburg, say "Hmm..."
Understand "it hurts when I go like this" as saying no when location is the Exam Room.
