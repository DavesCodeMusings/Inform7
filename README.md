# Inform7
Here you will find examples of interactive fiction, written in Inform 7.

* Bridge the Gap -- An example of making a room off limits to a player, but beyond the usual locked door. A space is divided into three rooms with the central room having a large chasm blocking the player's access. However, in the starting location, there is a ladder that can be used to span the chasm.
* Get Up First -- The player starts the story in bed and must leave the bed before being able to do anything else.
* Keys to the Attic -- It's the same old story, really. There's an interesting unmarked door, but it's locked and the player cannot enter without first finding the keys. In this case, the keys are on the floor of the bedroom closet.
* Shipboard -- Redefine directions to use fore, aft, port, and starboard, instead of north, south, east, and west. Also make 's' an abreviation for starboard and not south.
