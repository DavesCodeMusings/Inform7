# Inform7
Inform 7 provides a slick way to interactive fiction, but it's not always easy to find "how to" answers to complex problems using the manual. When I come across one of those head scratching scenarios that takes more than a few minutes to puzzle out, I'll make a note of it here. Partly this is to help me remember how it was solved, but hopefully it will be useful to other interactive fiction writers as well.

* Bridge the Gap -- An example of making a room off limits to a player, but beyond the usual locked door. A large chasm blocks the player's access. However, there is a ladder that can be used to span the chasm.
* Get Up First -- The player starts the story in bed and must leave the bed before being able to do anything else.
* Keys to the Attic -- It's the same old story, really. There's an interesting unmarked door, but it's locked and the player cannot enter without first finding the keys. In this case, the keys are on the floor of the bedroom closet.
* Say Ah -- Allow answering non-player characters with words in addition to yes, no, and sorry. In this case, getting a response from a doctor when asked to open up and say ah.
* Shipboard -- Redefine directions to use fore, aft, port, and starboard, instead of north, south, east, and west. Also make sure 's' is recognized as an abreviation for starboard and not south.
