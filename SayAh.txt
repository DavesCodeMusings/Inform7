"Say Ah" by DavesCodeMusings

[
  An example of non-player characters replying to something besides the usual yes, no, sorry.
  The idea to use 'Instead of answering Doctor Eckleburg that' came from Stack Overflow user
  Tehgby. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69790847/getting-a-simple-reply-from-a-character-in-inform-7

  Test with: "get on table / say ah"
]

The Exam Room is a room. "Why don't you hop up on the table and let's have a look at you."
In the Exam Room is a person called Doctor Eckleburg.
The exam table is a supporter in the Exam Room. It is fixed in place and enterable.
After entering the exam table, say "Open up and say ah."
Instead of answering Doctor Eckleburg that "ah", say "Mmm. Mm-hmm. Very interesting."
